# Learning C

🎒 Using this repo to store project for learning C.

## Lessons

I'll start with the [CS50 Harvard Course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/weeks/0/). I'll be doing **only weeks 0-5**.

### CS50

- [ ] **Week 0:** Scratch
- [ ] **Week 1:** C
- [ ] **Week 2:** Arrays
- [ ] Week 3: Algorithms
- [ ] **Week 4:** Memory
- [ ] **Week 5:** Data Structures

Next, I'll move onto [Exercism C track](https://exercism.org/tracks/c) in which I'll do **every problem** and not just the fun ones.

Next I'll run some code through the [Compiler Explorer "Think Like the Compiler"](https://godbolt.org/) to see how C code translates to assembly.

---

After this I'll do [LeetCode C](https://leetcode.com/problemset/?search=c) problems to focus on confidence programming in C.

---

After that, I'll try to build some projects to solidify my knowledge in the language.

---

After it gets boring, I'll move onto learn C++ because I'm sure I'll be missing classes and objects by then.

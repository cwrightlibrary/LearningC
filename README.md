# Learning C

🎒 Using this repo to store project for learning C.

## Lessons

I'll start my going through the [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) C projects and move on from there.

### [Project 1: Calculate A Student's Average](https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_projects.php)

> [`/projects/student_average_calculator/calculator.c`](/projects/student_average_calculator/calculator.c)

First, I'll build the app as written in the guide. Next, I'll continue on to the practice challenge, a program that:

- Asks the user to enter up to 5 items they need to buy
- Stores the items in an array
- Prints the full shopping list
- Counts how many items were entered
- *Extra challenge:* Add a feature that lets the user search for an item and tells them if it is in the list
